#binspec
A preprocessing/peak identification, classification, and feature ranking R library for mass spectra. The preprocessing algorithm is an extension of Yasui's peak-finding algorithm (https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/teaching/statgen/2004/refs/yasui.pdf), the classifiers available are radial kernel support vector machines (tuned with leave-one-out classification) and random forests (tuned with out-of-bag error), with the random forests providing a utility for ranking features based on mean decrease in Gini impurity.  We also provide a parallelized training function that allows for training classifiers on multiple sets of preprocessing parameters at once.
